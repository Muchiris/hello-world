#My first Repo

Yellow! I am but your herald boy in the art of the number. 
An eccentric human specimen smouldered in the glorious epiphany of Big Data.

This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognised by yourself
as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap;
the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments complaining 
that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege
to do for it whatever I can.
I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. 
Life is no brief candle to me.
It is a sort fo splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment, and I want to make it burn
as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations.
